         Gerrit review's comments preparation helper (Herr Vim)

Gerrit (https://www.gerritcodereview.com/) code review system by default
has Web-based interface for creating comments for review. It requires to
be online, with enabled JavaScript. It does not play well with some
browsers that captures keystrokes. IT has no ability to change interface
to something more convenient and comfortable to work with.

Fortunately it has some API that provides ability to post bunch of
comments for review in JSON format and you can use it to publish
comments created with convenient offline tools.

This Vim plugin is intended to be Web-interface replacement for review
creation process. It uses Vim with Fugitive plugin to create a temporary
file (gerrvim.txt) with aggregated comments. Then this gerrvim.txt file
is converted to JSON suitable to be posted to Gerrit like this (or use
REST-API interface):

    gerrvim2json.pl /tmp/gerrvim.txt | ssh gerrit gerrit review --json

It allows creation of multiline optional review message and comments for
line ranges inside files.

Installation instruction is in INSTALL.
Format of the temporary gerrvim.txt file is described in gerrvim2json.pl.

gerrvim is free software: see the file COPYING for copying conditions.
