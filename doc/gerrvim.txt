*gerrvim.txt*  Gerrit review's comments preparation helper

CONFIGURATION                                    *gerrvim-configuration*

The only option is the placement of temporary file with aggregated
comments. By default it is /tmp/gerrvim.txt. You can override it
in your .vimrc: >
    let g:gerrvim_file = "/another/path.txt"

USAGE                                                          *gerrvim*

* Open necessary commit using Fugitive (:Gedit) and file inside it
* Visually select a bunch of code lines you want to comment
* Press <Leader>cc (usually "\cc") or call :Gerrvim command
  specifying the range
* You will see an additional small window with your code
* Add necessary comment message below -----END----- line
* Either press <CR> in normal mode, or save buffer and exit
* Comment window will be closed, saving your consolidated changes
  in temporary file
* To wipe out all your comments type :GerrvimClear (or remove that
  temporary file)

Copied original text (that is between BEGIN and END line) won't be
published in Gerrit. It exists just for your convenience.
